## Project idea

During my time as a teacher in Special Education, I placed a strong focus on self-reflection and developing daily habits with my students. I believed it was essential for students to assess their own performance, allowing teachers to provide meaningful feedback afterward. Inspired by this approach, I set out to create an application that facilitates a personal rating system, enabling students to track their progress while offering better organization through timetables.
